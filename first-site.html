<p> I love my little brother so much I swear everytime I go to my moms 
    house the only person I say hi to is my brother then we do our "secret"
    handshake walk to my room then either play roblox or watch Dinosaur Ice Age 
    (sometimes we play fortnite or spiderman but only if he lets me..)
    Most of the time if it's hot enough outside we will play on the trampoline 
    or go on the swings sometimes even go in the pool or we go see the animals.
    (we go to blanford all the time to see the goats and stuff.) 
</p>

<h3> why my brother is cool and swaglicous. </h3>
<img src="images/IANNNN.jpeg"alt="iannn">
<p> 
    my brother is so much cooler than yours (if you have one.) because he 
    has hella swag and thats only cause I dress him and buy his clothes
    (jst because I dress boring at school doesn't mean I don't have hella 
    swag outside of school) he's also cooler than your brother because 
    hes my favorite person that I live with and basically in the whole world,
we also agree on like everythingso that also makes him cooler than your brother and all of your siblings
(hes like 3 years old so I can get him to agree with me on basically anything I want )

<p> we also have the same interests!! we both like playing roblox and computers
    (he ripped my old laptop apart with his bare hands..) and he helps
    me clean my room!! ( he throws all his dirty dishes, his toys, his clothes, and other random
    stuff he finds around the house on the floor in my room.)
</p>

<h3> more about me and my brother!!</h3>
<img src="images/iann.jpeg"alt="iannnn">
<p> When I first met my brother I thought he was going to be as annoying as my little sister and I was kinda right..
    at first when he got home from the hospital he would scream cry non stop, on my life he would be screaming so loud he would turn red like super red.. 
      <p> but now he isn't annoying and is my best frennnn, he's so chill now me and him sit and play dinosaurs all the time 
        (only if he lets me, if you take something from him without asking he will start screaming and crying..) sometimes we be getting 
        into fist fights but thats okay!!  if you're not getting into fits fights with your siblings your not really siblings miss gurl. 
        (he beat me with a tree branch like 2 days ago..send help asap.) </p>
        <p>he's so cool and we kinda look the same and we both r cool and swagalicious . 
            I also taught my brother how to dap, high five, fist bump, and allat cool stuff when he was a little baby so now 
            he's gonna get so many frenz and he's gonna be so cool.
            At the end of the day my brother is cooler than you and your brother and he's my favorite person in the whole world. 
            even though he comes into my room at 1 am begging me to hang out with him...</p>
